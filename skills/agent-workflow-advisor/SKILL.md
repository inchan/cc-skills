# Agent Workflow Advisor

## Overview

This skill serves as the **entry point** for the 5 agent pattern skills, helping you select the optimal workflow pattern for your task. It analyzes your request and provides a **recommendation with reasoning**, but you make the final decision.

**Reference**: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents

### Purpose

> "When building agents, you should start with the simplest solution possible, adding complexity only when needed."

This advisor helps you:
1. **Understand** your task's characteristics
2. **Match** to the best-fit pattern
3. **Decide** with confidence which skill to use

**This skill does NOT execute tasks** - it recommends the right tool for the job.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this advisor when:
- **Uncertain** which pattern fits your task
- **Starting** a complex project
- **Learning** the agent pattern system
- **Want validation** of your pattern choice

## Quick Pattern Reference

| Pattern | Best For | Key Characteristic |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **No Pattern** | Simple, single-step tasks | Direct execution, no overhead |
| **Sequential** (Prompt Chaining) | Fixed multi-step tasks | Validation gates between steps |
| **Router** (Routing) | Task classification & delegation | Categorize → Route to specialist |
| **Parallel** (Parallelization) | Independent work or voting | Concurrent execution, merge results |
| **Orchestrator** (Orchestrator-Workers) | Open-ended complex projects | Dynamic subtask discovery |
| **Evaluator** (Evaluator-Optimizer) | Quality improvement | Feedback loop until threshold met |

## Critical First Question: Do You Even Need a Pattern?

**Before recommending any pattern, I ask:**

> "Is this task simple enough that a pattern would add overhead without benefit?"

### When NO PATTERN is Best

**Complexity < 0.3** AND any of:
- Single file change
- One clear action (fix this bug, add this field)
- Less than 10 minutes of work
- No validation checkpoints needed
- No parallel opportunities

**Examples of "No Pattern" tasks:**
- "Fix null pointer in UserService line 45"
- "Add email field to User model"
- "Update README with new installation step"
- "Rename variable from 'temp' to 'userCount'"

**My response for simple tasks:**
```markdown
## Recommendation: No Pattern Needed

This task is straightforward enough to execute directly.

**Why no pattern:**
- Single action required
- No validation gates needed
- Complexity: 0.2 (Low)
- Estimated time: < 10 minutes

**Just do it:**
[Direct instructions for the task]

**If this turns out to be more complex:**
Come back and we'll reassess with more information.
```

**Philosophy**: Patterns are tools, not requirements. Simple tasks done simply.

## Analysis Framework

When you describe your task, I analyze it across 5 dimensions:

### 1. Task Structure
- **Fixed steps** → Sequential
- **Multiple categories** → Router
- **Independent parts** → Parallel
- **Unknown scope** → Orchestrator
- **Quality focus** → Evaluator

### 2. Complexity Score (0.0 - 1.0)
- **< 0.3** (Low): Simple, single-step task → Maybe no pattern needed
- **0.3 - 0.5** (Medium-Low): Clear steps → Sequential or Router
- **0.5 - 0.7** (Medium): Multiple components → Parallel or Sequential
- **0.7 - 0.9** (High): Complex, multi-faceted → Orchestrator
- **> 0.9** (Very High): System-level changes → Orchestrator + Evaluator

### 3. Predictability
- **Predictable subtasks** → Sequential or Parallel
- **Unpredictable subtasks** → Orchestrator
- **Known categories** → Router
- **Clear quality metrics** → Evaluator

### 4. Dependencies
- **Sequential dependencies** → Sequential
- **No dependencies** → Parallel
- **Dynamic dependencies** → Orchestrator

### 5. Success Criteria
- **Step completion** → Sequential
- **Correct routing** → Router
- **Speed/consensus** → Parallel
- **Adaptive delivery** → Orchestrator
- **Quality threshold** → Evaluator

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Describe Your Task

Provide:
- What you want to accomplish
- Any known constraints
- Quality requirements
- Time/resource constraints

**Example**: "I want to build a user authentication system with login, registration, password reset, and OAuth integration."

### Step 2: Receive Analysis

I'll provide:

```markdown
## Task Analysis

1. [Why this pattern fits]
2. [Key characteristics match]
3. [Trade-offs considered]

**Alternative Patterns**:
- [Pattern B]: Use if [condition]
- [Pattern C]: Use if [different condition]

### Execution Guidance

If you choose [Recommended Pattern]:
1. First step: [What to do first]
2. Key considerations: [What to watch for]
3. Expected outcome: [What success looks like]

### Questions to Consider
- [Question that might change recommendation]
- [Clarification that could help]
```

### Step 3: Make Your Decision

You decide:
- Accept the recommendation
- Choose an alternative
- Ask for more analysis
- Proceed without a pattern (for simple tasks)

## Pattern Selection Decision Tree

```
Is the task simple enough to do in one shot? (Complexity < 0.3?)
├─ Yes → NO PATTERN - just do it directly
└─ No → Continue analysis
         │
         Is the task about categorizing/routing different inputs?
         ├─ Yes → ROUTER pattern
         └─ No → Continue
                  │
                  Are all subtasks known upfront?
                  ├─ Yes → Do subtasks have dependencies?
                  │         ├─ Yes (must do A before B) → SEQUENTIAL pattern
                  │         │
                  │         └─ No (A and B are independent)
                  │                  │
                  │                  Want to compare approaches or split work?
                  │                  ├─ Compare → PARALLEL (Voting mode)
                  │                  └─ Split → PARALLEL (Sectioning mode)
                  │
                  └─ No (subtasks emerge during work)
                           │
                           Is it about improving existing output?
                           ├─ Yes → EVALUATOR pattern
                           └─ No → ORCHESTRATOR pattern
                                    │
                                    Need quality validation after?
                                    ├─ Yes → Add EVALUATOR at end
                                    └─ No → Orchestrator alone
```

## Critical Decision Points (Disambiguations)

### 1. Sequential vs Parallel: The Dependency Test

**Ask**: "Can I do task B without completing task A first?"

```markdown
## Dependency Analysis

Task: "Build user profile feature with upload, crop, and save"

Subtasks:
1. Design UI component
2. Create backend API
3. Set up S3 storage
4. Implement image processing

**Dependency Check:**
- UI needs API contract? → **YES, dependency exists**
- API needs S3 config? → **YES, dependency exists**
- UI and S3 setup simultaneously? → **NO, UI needs final endpoint**

**Result**: Sequential (dependencies force ordering)
**Alternative**: Define API contract FIRST, then Parallel for implementation

---

Task: "Run unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests"

**Dependency Check:**
- Unit tests need integration tests? → **NO**
- E2E needs unit tests? → **NO** (can run independently)

**Result**: Parallel (Sectioning) - all independent
```

**Rule**: If ANY subtask depends on another's OUTPUT, use Sequential. If all independent, use Parallel.

### 2. Parallel(Voting) vs Evaluator: Compare or Improve?

**Ask**: "Am I comparing different approaches OR improving a single approach?"

```markdown
## Voting vs Evaluator Decision

**Scenario A: Algorithm Selection**
"Best algorithm for user search - linear, binary, or hash?"

- Multiple approaches exist
- Need to compare and pick best
- One-time decision

**Result**: PARALLEL (Voting)
- Try all 3 approaches
- Score each on criteria
- Select winner

---

**Scenario B: Code Quality Improvement**
"Improve this API endpoint's security and performance"

- One existing implementation
- Need iterative improvement
- Clear quality thresholds to meet

**Result**: EVALUATOR
- Evaluate current state
- Provide feedback
- Apply improvements
- Re-evaluate until threshold met
```

**Key Distinction**:
- **Voting**: "Which approach is best?" (comparison)
- **Evaluator**: "How do I make this better?" (refinement)

### 3. Sequential vs Orchestrator: Known vs Discovered

**Ask**: "Do I know ALL subtasks upfront, or will I discover them?"

```markdown
## Known vs Discovered Subtasks

**Scenario A: User Authentication**
"Add JWT auth, OAuth, 2FA support"

Known upfront:
1. JWT implementation
2. OAuth integration
3. 2FA setup

But wait... during implementation:
- Need token refresh logic (discovered)
- Need rate limiting (discovered)
- Need session management (discovered)

**Result**: ORCHESTRATOR
- Initial subtasks known, but more will emerge
- Need adaptive planning

---

**Scenario B: Report Generation**
"Generate quarterly sales report"

Known upfront:
1. Fetch data
2. Calculate metrics
3. Generate charts
4. Compile PDF

No new subtasks expected.

**Result**: SEQUENTIAL
- All steps predictable
- Use gates for validation
```

**Rule**:
- Known and fixed → Sequential
- Known but will grow → Orchestrator

### 4. Complexity Score: Guide, Not Gospel

**The score is a signal, not a decision:**

```markdown
## Complexity as Secondary Factor

**High Complexity (0.8) but Simple Structure**
"Migrate 100 database tables to new schema"
- Complexity: 0.8 (lots of work)
- Structure: Repetitive (same operation 100x)
- Pattern: PARALLEL (Sectioning) - batch process

NOT Orchestrator just because complexity is high.

---

**Low Complexity (0.4) but Needs Gates**
"Add input validation to API endpoint"
- Complexity: 0.4 (straightforward)
- Structure: Needs verification at each step
- Pattern: SEQUENTIAL - validate each change

NOT "No Pattern" just because complexity is low.
```

**Priority Order**:
1. **Structure** (dependencies, predictability)
2. **Goal** (compare vs improve vs build)
3. **Complexity** (as tie-breaker)

## Pattern Combinations

Sometimes one pattern isn't enough:

### Common Combinations

**1. Router → Any Pattern**
```
Task comes in → Router classifies → Routes to appropriate pattern
```
Use when: Multiple types of tasks need handling

**2. Orchestrator → Parallel/Sequential (nested)**
```
Orchestrator decomposes → Some subtasks are parallel, some sequential
```
Use when: Complex project with mixed dependency structures

**3. Any Pattern → Evaluator (chain)**
```
Pattern completes → Evaluator validates quality → Feedback loop if needed
```
Use when: Quality assurance is critical

**4. Sequential with Parallel Steps**
```
Step 1 → Step 2 (parallel: A,B,C) → Step 3 → Step 4
```
Use when: Some steps have independent subtasks

### When NOT to Combine

- Don't add Evaluator if quality is already checked by gates (Sequential)
- Don't use Router if task type is already clear
- Don't nest Orchestrator inside Orchestrator (too complex)

## Complete Analysis Example

### User Request
"우리 레거시 모놀리식 앱을 마이크로서비스로 분리하고 싶어요. User, Product, Order 세 개의 서비스로 나눌 계획입니다."

### Analysis

```markdown
## Task Analysis: Monolith to Microservices Migration

### Task Summary
Decompose a legacy monolithic application into 3 microservices: User Service, Product Service, and Order Service.

### Characteristics Detected
- **Structure**: Semi-fixed (3 known services, but internal details unknown)
- **Complexity**: 0.85 (High)
  - Multi-component system changes
  - Database splitting required
  - API contract design needed
  - Integration concerns
- **Subtasks**: Mixed (3 services known, but implementation details will emerge)
- **Dependencies**: Complex (services may have shared data, APIs must be coordinated)

### Pattern Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation**: 🎯 **ORCHESTRATOR** (Dynamic Task Orchestrator)

**Reasoning**:
1. **High complexity (0.85)** - Multiple services with unknown internal requirements
2. **Discovery needed** - Will find hidden dependencies during analysis
3. **Multiple specialists required** - Code analysis, architecture design, implementation, testing
4. **Adaptive planning essential** - Scope will evolve as legacy code is analyzed

**Why not other patterns?**
- ❌ Sequential: Too rigid, can't handle discovered dependencies
- ❌ Parallel: Services aren't fully independent (shared DB, APIs)
- ❌ Router: Not about categorizing, it's about building
- ✅ Evaluator: Could add after, for quality validation

**Alternative Patterns**:
- **PARALLEL (Sectioning)**: Use if services are truly independent with no shared state
  - Condition: Each service has separate database and no inter-service calls
  - Benefit: Faster execution (3 services simultaneously)
  - Risk: Integration issues discovered late

- **SEQUENTIAL + EVALUATOR**: Use if you want strict phase gates
  - Condition: Must validate each service before starting next
  - Benefit: Catch issues early
  - Risk: Slower, less adaptive

### Execution Guidance

If you choose **ORCHESTRATOR**:

1. **First step**: Analyze legacy codebase
   - Assign Code Analyzer Worker
   - Discover actual dependencies
   - Map data flows between modules

2. **Key considerations**:
   - Database splitting strategy (shared → separate)
   - API contract versioning
   - Data migration plan
   - Rollback strategy

3. **Expected workflow**:
   - Start with 3 known services
   - Likely discover 5-8 additional subtasks (shared auth, API gateway, etc.)
   - Expect 3-5 replanning cycles
   - Duration: 2-4 hours of orchestrated work

4. **Success metrics**:
   - All 3 services independently deployable
   - Integration tests passing
   - No direct database sharing
   - API contracts documented

### Questions to Consider

1. **독립성**: 세 서비스가 데이터베이스를 공유하나요, 아니면 각각 분리된 DB를 사용할 예정인가요?
   - If shared DB → Orchestrator definitely (need to plan splitting)
   - If separate DBs → Parallel might work

2. **기존 테스트**: 레거시 앱에 테스트가 있나요?
   - If yes → Use them to validate migration
   - If no → Add Test Engineer worker priority

3. **다운타임**: 마이그레이션 중 다운타임이 허용되나요?
   - If no downtime → Need more careful planning, Orchestrator essential
   - If downtime OK → Simpler migration possible

### My Recommendation

Given the complexity and need for discovery, **start with ORCHESTRATOR**.

To activate:
```
"orchestrator 패턴으로 마이크로서비스 마이그레이션 진행해주세요"
```

Or if you want quality validation at the end:
```
"orchestrator로 마이그레이션 후 evaluator로 품질 검증해주세요"
```
